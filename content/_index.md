# Serverless CRUD API with AWS Lambda and function URLs

This workshop will guide you to create a serverless CRUD API with only 2 AWS services:

- AWS Lambda
- Amazon DynamoDB

You will also learn about

- _directly_ invoking Lambda functions in 3 ways
- who can invoke your Lambda functions (aka _access permissions_)
- how your Lambda functions access other AWS resources (e.g. DynamoDB table)

The high level architecture looks like this:
